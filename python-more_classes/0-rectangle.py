This module defines an empty class `Rectangle`.

The `Rectangle` class serves as a placeholder for a rectangle object, 
which could be expanded in the future with attributes (e.g., width, height)
and methods (e.g., area, perimeter). The current version of this class is empty 
and does not define any attributes or methods.

This class is intended to be a starting point for further implementation.
