Test Case 1:
Input:
    a = 1
    b = 2
Expected Output:
    3
Explanation:
    Regular addition of two integers.

Test Case 2:
Input:
    a = 1
    b = -2
Expected Output:
    -1
Explanation:
    Addition of a positive integer and a negative integer.

Test Case 3:
Input:
    a = 1.4
    b = 2
Expected Output:
    3
Explanation:
    Addition of a float and an integer (casting the float to an integer).

Test Case 4:
Input:
    a = 1
    b = "2"
Expected Output:
    TypeError: b must be an integer
Explanation:
    The second argument is a string, which is invalid.

Test Case 5 (Missing second argument, uses default for `b`):
Input:
    a = 1
Expected Output:
    99
Explanation:
    Missing second argument, so `b` defaults to 98. The result is `1 + 98 = 99`.

Test Case 6 (Missing both arguments):
Input:
    No arguments provided
Expected Output:
    TypeError: missing required argument 'a'
Explanation:
    Both arguments are missing, which should raise a `TypeError`.

Test Case 7:
Input:
    a = 1.5
    b = 2.7
Expected Output:
    3
Explanation:
    Both arguments are floats. The function will cast them to integers before adding.

Test Case 8 (Invalid type - `a` is a list):
Input:
    a = [1]
    b = 2
Expected Output:
    TypeError: a must be an integer
Explanation:
    The first argument is a list, which is invalid.

Test Case 9 (Invalid type - `b` is a list):
Input:
    a = 1
    b = [2]
Expected Output:
    TypeError: b must be an integer
Explanation:
    The second argument is a list, which is invalid.

Test Case 10 (Float overflow):
Input:
    a = 1e100
    b = 2e100
Expected Output:
    3e100
Explanation:
    Very large float numbers should be handled by the function correctly.

Test Case 11 (Cannot convert `NaN` to integer):
Input:
    a = float('nan')
    b = 1
Expected Output:
    TypeError: cannot convert float NaN to integer
Explanation:
    `NaN` (Not a Number) cannot be converted to an integer and should raise a `TypeError`.

Test Case 12 (Integer with float input):
Input:
    a = 1.999
    b = 2
Expected Output:
    3
Explanation:
    The float `1.999` is cast to an integer before the addition.

Test Case 13 (Zero addition):
Input:
    a = 0
    b = 0
Expected Output:
    0
Explanation:
    Adding two zeros should return `0`.

Test Case 14 (Edge case: extremely large integer addition):
Input:
    a = 999999999999999999999
    b = 1000000000000000000000
Expected Output:
    1999999999999999999999
Explanation:
    The function should handle very large integers without error.
